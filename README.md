### README ###

* This solver is just used for one tutorial that I made named heatedACMI

* The solver was derived from the basic laplacianFoam by Nico Speelman

* I did not check the solver in detail but everything seems to be fine

### Compilation ###

* Clone the repository using git
* Load your OpenFOAM-4.x environment
* Build it by excecuting wmake
* Done
